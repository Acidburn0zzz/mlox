Please visit the the tes3lint wiki page for the latest information on using
tes3lint:  http://code.google.com/p/mlox/wiki/Tes3lint

You can also run tes3linthelp.bat

You should extract the tes3lint archive somewhere under your Morrowind
directory. If you do not have a preferred place, just extract it in the
Morrowind directory itself. It will create a directory called tes3lint,
containing all the files.
