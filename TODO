- automatic pseudo-rules for "Clean *" names?

- deactivate "update load order" button, and change text after update
  and deactivate if pasting "from file".

- sash behavior for load order panes.

- menu in current load order pane text widget
  - paste in from clipboard
  - open from file dialog

- rename data files .mlox, allow mod authors to place their own .mlox
  files into Data Files directory. or better in Data Files/mlox/*.txt!
  main.mlox, user.mlox ???
