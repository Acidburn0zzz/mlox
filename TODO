- windows svn clients: RapidSVN, or TortoiseSVN

- maybe, maybe allow mod authors to publish rules files in Data
  Files/mlox/*.txt Tricky, potential for rules filename collisions.

========================================
Implementing a full boolean language:

- macros (???)

- Parser
- PrettyPrinter
- message and plugin names: (readstring function)

- check version number from filename or plugin header doc string?
Version Check:
(version < N ...)

plugin names: assume they mean (active plugin.esp) unless 
otherwise noted.

--------------------
New: [REQUIRES comment] a [AND b, c, d]

Means: a REQUIRES b AND c AND d
Read: "If aaa is active then bbb, ccc, ddd must also be active."

--------------------
New: [REQUIRES comment] a [OR b, c, d]

Means: a REQUIRES b OR c OR d
Read: "If a is active then one of b, c, d must be active."

--------------------
New: [REQUIRES comment] [AND a, b, c] d

Means: a AND b AND c REQUIRE d
Read: "If a, b, c are active then d must also be active."

--------------------------------------------------
Illegal Characters in Windows: ? [ ] / \ = + < > : ; " * | (and ^ if FAT)

BOOLEAN expressions:

a (means plugin "a" is active)
[AND a, b, c]  -> a AND b AND c
[OR a, b, c]   -> a OR b OR c
[NOT a, b]  -> (NOT a) AND (NOT b) -> (NOT (a OR b))

OTHER FUNCTIONS:

[DOC pattern plugin] is true if the doc-string in header of plugin
matches pattern

[VER [>|<|=|>=|<=] N plugin] true if the version comparison is true
for the given plugin, the version is taken from the plugin name by
regexp or from the docstring by regexp.

STATEMENTS (RULES):
* statement starts with "^\[(REQUIRES|CONFLICT|NOTE|PATCH|ORDER|NEARSTART|NEAREND)"

[REQUIRES comment] cond1 cond2 (REQUIRES IF cond1 THEN cond2 must be true)
If cond1, then cond2 must be true, otherwise print missing req error
[REQUIRES comment] a [AND b, c, d]
[REQUIRES comment] a [OR b, c, d]
[REQUIRES comment] [AND a, b, c] d
[REQUIRES
 comment
 comment]
 [AND a, b, c] d

[CONFLICT] cond1 cond2... condN (CONFLICT IF ANYTWO cond ARE TRUE)
IF any two cond, then print conflict error
[CONFLICT comment] a,b,c
[CONFLICT comment] a,b [OR c,d]

[NOTE] cond1 (NOTE IF cond)
If cond then print note
[NOTE comment] a
[NOTE comment] [AND a,b]

[PATCH] cond1 cond2 (PATCH IF cond1 THEN cond2 AND IF cond2 THEN cond1)
if cond1 then cond2 must be true
and if cond2 is true, then cond1 must be true
