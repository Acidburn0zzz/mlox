- convert mlox-data to CRLF :(
  - Dragon32: Done (not sure on version)

- auto-updater so that program/data updates are automatically downloaded and installed.
  (will need a preferences file for URL from which to retrieve updates and if user wants to turn it off).
  - Dragon32: Done in 0.59. No preferences file, URL is hardcoded in mlox.py; commandline switch to turn off auto-updating

- CSV file for plugin name aliases
  - Dragon32: i.e. allow user to specify one plugin includes one or more other plugins

- Change error reporting to use a popup, instead of mlox.err :(
  - Dragon32: Done in 0.56

- If 2 plugins have the same timestamp, force a "unsorted" state so they can be sorted.

- maybe, maybe allow mod authors to publish rules files in Data
  Files/mlox/*.txt Tricky, potential for rules filename collisions.

- refactor code.

- compile rules files to .pkl versions when changed. and load from .pkl!

- Get rid of mlox.bat, no longer needed I think.
  - Dragon32: Done, removed in 0.59; anyone with a recent version of Python can just double-click .py files in Windows

+Added by Dragon32:

- internationalisation bug (cope with plugin names containing non-standard characters like £)

- program preferences (including the download location for mlox-data.7z)

- mlox community rule editing website and option to automatically update from rules website so user does not have manually download rules.

- allow user to suppress any given warning. 

- highlight the text of Conflict rules in yellow
