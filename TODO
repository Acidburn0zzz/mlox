- convert mlox-data to CRLF :(

- auto-updater so that program/data updates are automatically downloaded and installed.
  (will need a preferences file for URL from which to retrieve updates and if user wants to turn it off).

- CSV file for plugin name aliases

- Change error reporting to use a popup, instead of mlox.err :(

- If 2 plugins have the same timestamp, force a "unsorted" state so they can be sorted.

- maybe, maybe allow mod authors to publish rules files in Data
  Files/mlox/*.txt Tricky, potential for rules filename collisions.

- refactor code.

- compile rules files to .pkl versions when changed. and load from .pkl!

- Get rid of mlox.bat, no longer needed I think.
