CONFLICT["ddddd.esp" <-> "eeeee.esp"]:
 | These plugins conflict because they modify the same GMST.
NOTE["bbbbb.esp"]
 | This esp is obsolete, you should be using bbbbX.esp instead.
 | The reason is that we need to add this long message to test
 | multi-line messages and it's hard to think up something
 | worthy to put here. Not worthy, not worthy. Just wordy. Lo
 | our modern life is fraught with popsicles. I mean obstacles.
