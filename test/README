Make sure that you have a valid mlox_base.txt and mlox_user.txt in
this directory first.

To run the tests, first make sure mlox.py is in your PATH.
Then run the individual shell scripts (testX.sh)
To cleanup, do: ./cleanup

The directory userfiles contains people's plugins lists posted on the
"Post your .ini mod list" thread at Bethsoft:
http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=632243&hl=

You can run mlox.py on them all in one go:
% mlox.py -wf $u userfiles/*.txt
